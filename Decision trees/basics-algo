This is one of my favorite algorithm and I use it quite frequently. 
It is a type of supervised learning algorithm that is mostly used for classification problems.
Surprisingly, it works for both categorical and continuous dependent variables. 
In this algorithm, we split the population into two or more homogeneous sets. 
This is done based on most significant attributes/ independent variables to make as distinct groups as possible. 
In this particular repo I am implementing the standard algorithms for decision trees namely C5.0,1R,RIPPER.
