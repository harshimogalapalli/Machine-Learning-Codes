K-nearest neighbours works by directly measuring the (Euclidean) distance between observations and inferring the class 
of unlabelled data from the class of its nearest neighbours.
setting value of k is similar to bias variance tradeoff.
Common practise of setting k is squareroot of number of training examples.
